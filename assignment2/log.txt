The correctneess is pretty self evident I think, and seems to accurate (at least as accurate as running on one machine)

Performance: this one was honestly a little hard to measure or observe,
as the perforance on the local vm was terrible, and so while the client server
setup is also not great, its not any worse than running just on the VM. 

The elegance is mostly just what was described in the spec, two structs, one 
for networking and one for the local processing (on both the client and the server). 
There were improvments I could've made, and I'll probably make for part3 that I didn't
have time for, like using image compression and a variable package size when sending the image, 
and only sending the dnn output back instead of the whole image

Running part 2:
from base directory: 
client - 
sh client.sh 

server - 
sh server.sh
